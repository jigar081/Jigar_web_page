        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Jigar is a Hindi word that translates to "heart" in English. 
            It is often used in the context of love, affection, and emotions. In Hindi literature, 
            Jigar has been used extensively to express various human emotions, 
            and it has become an integral part of Hindi poetry.In Hindi poetry, 
            Jigar is often used to express the pain of separation, the joy of togetherness,
            and the longing for love. Poets have used Jigar in their compositions to evoke strong emotions in the readers. 
            For example, the famous poet Mirza Ghalib has used Jigar extensively in his works to express the depth of his love and the pain of separation.
            Apart from love, Jigar is also used to express other emotions such as courage, determination, and strength.
            When we say someone has a "lion's heart," we mean they have the courage and strength to face any challenge that comes their way.
            In Hindi, this is expressed as "Jigar ka tukda," which means a piece of the heart.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Success is something that everyone strives for in their life, but achieving success is not an easy task. It requires dedication, hard work, and a willingness to learn from failures. In this essay, we will discuss how to achieve success.
            The first step towards achieving success is to set clear goals. You need to define what success means to you and set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals that align with your definition of success. Without clear goals, you will not have a direction and will not be able to measure your progress.
            Once you have set your goals, the next step is to develop a plan of action. You need to identify the steps you need to take, the resources you need, and the timeline for each step. This plan will help you stay on track and ensure that you are taking the right steps towards achieving your goals.
            Success requires hard work, so be prepared to put in the effort required to achieve your goals. Stay focused, stay motivated, and stay disciplined. You need to work hard consistently, and persevere through tough times. Success is not achieved overnight, but rather is the result of consistent effort over a prolonged period of time.
            It is important to learn from your failures. Failure is a part of the journey to success. Identify what went wrong, and use that knowledge to make improvements. Do not let failures discourage you, but rather let them motivate you to do better.
